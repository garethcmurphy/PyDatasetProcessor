That is thinner than last year's B4C mask that we put together from four ~0.5 cm thickmasks to get 2*2mm2 and 5*5mm2 openings.Going from 3 mm diameter opening to 1 mm diameter opening is going to 1/9 of the area. ~330kcounts @ 3mm with 30kcounts background means we should havemeasured more like 63kcounts with the 1 mm diameter opening. If the angle that the neutrons came into this 1 mm diameter opening was off by just alittle, a lot of neutrons would be blocked. Maybe that's what happened?The useful-neutrons-to-backgorund ratio will be better at 2.0 \u00c5 so if we want to use the smallest collimator, we should use 2.0 \u00c5 neutrons.> This is interesting.

The ADC spectra are dominated by the pedestal originating from theread-out of all channels on every trigger.Shown are data for run 24, limited to the first 100.000 data entries.ASCM data files can be read and plotted with the plot scripts starting from commit 59aad20."
